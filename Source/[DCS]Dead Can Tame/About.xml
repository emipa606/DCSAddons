	In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can scan the memories from corpses and make them to psychic lances.
	
	In mod [More Lances],you can buy more kinds of psychic lancer.
	
	And with this mod, you can use MemoryDisk to make and upgrade some of these Lances.
	
	1.Can upgrade tamming lance to higher level (from small to medium to all)
	2.Can upgarde Psychic Shock Lance to KnockOut Lance
	3.Can turn Psychic Soothe Pulser to Brainwash Lance
	
	So yes, you can use dead people's memories to tame any living creatures or cool them down(...by knock them out) 
	
	This mod must be loaded behind the [Dead Can Serve] and [More Lances].
