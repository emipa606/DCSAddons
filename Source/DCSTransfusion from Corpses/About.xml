	In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can draw blood from the corpses and simply use [blood bag] as medicine.
	
	In Dalrae's mod [Blood Pack], you can draw blood from the living people and use [blood pack] to do blood transfusion to cure blood loss.
	
	In this mod, you can turn my [blood bag] to [blood pack]. 
	
	So, yes, it means you can also do blood transfusion from corpse.
	
	This mod must be loaded behind the [Dead Can Serve] and [Blood Pack].
