		This Mod add recipes which allow you turn [BloodBag] from my mod [Dead Can Serve] into [blood pack (lowblood)] from  Jecrell's mod  [Rim of Madness - Vampires].
		
		So yes, with this Submod, now you can feed your Vampires with the blood from Corpses.
		
		You can find the recipes in Stove or DrugLab.
		
		"A decent vampire will not take someone else's first-aid medicine for a drink.If you want to invite them to drink from the blood bag,at least first remove the medical label on the bag.Anyway,it won't taste well because it's only from the corpse."
		
		[Dead Can Serve] AND [Rim of Madness - Vampires] MUST BE LOADED BEFORE THIS MOD !!!!!
