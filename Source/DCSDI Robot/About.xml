	In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can scan the memories from corpses and use them as AI.
	
	In Haplo's mod [Misc. Robots],you can buy independent and movable robots to free your pawns from cleaning and hauling.
	
	And with this mod, you can use MemoryDisk to build the Robots!! No need to wait for the trader and craft whenever and how many you want !!
	
	Of course, you need to unlock the research "Intelligent Servers" in [Dead Can Serve] techtree. Recipes are in the Fabrication Bench.
	
	If you think they cost too much or too less , feel free to report.
	
	This mod must be loaded after the [Dead Can Serve] and [More Misc. Robots]. Put it below these two mods in mods order setting !!
