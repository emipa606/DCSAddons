# [DCS] DI Robot

DI for Dead Intelligence
In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can scan the memories from brains in corpses and use them as AI.
In Haplo&apos;s mod https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=724602224][Misc. Robots],you can buy independent and movable robots to free your pawns from cleaning and hauling.
And with this mod, you can use MemoryDisk to build the Robots!! No need to wait for the trader and craft whenever and how many you want !!
Of course, you need to unlock the research &quot;Intelligent Servers&quot; in [Dead Can Serve] techtree. Recipes are in the Fabrication Bench.

# [DCS]Feed the Vampire

This Mod add recipes which allow you turn [BloodBag] from my mod [Dead Can Serve] into [blood pack (lowblood)] from Jecrell&apos;s mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2369553686][Rim of Madness - Vampires].
So yes, with this Submod, now you can feed your Vampires with the blood from Corpses.
You can find the recipes in Stove or DrugLab.
&quot;A decent vampire will not take someone else&apos;s first-aid medicine for a drink.If you want to invite them to drink from the blood bag,at least first remove the medical label on the bag.Anyway,it won&apos;t taste well because it&apos;s only from the corpse.&quot;

# [DCS]Dead Can Tame

In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can scan the memories from corpses and make them to psychic lances.

1.Can upgrade tamming lance to higher level (from small to medium to all)
2.Can upgarde Psychic Shock Lance to KnockOut Lance
3.Can turn Psychic Soothe Pulser to Brainwash Lance
So yes, you can use dead people&apos;s memories to tame any living creatures or cool them down(...by knock them out)
of course, you need to finish the research Psychic Interference or Memory Modification in Dead Can Serve mod.

# [DCS]Transfusion from Corpses

In my mod [Dead Can Serve],you can draw blood from the corpses and simply use [blood bag] as medicine.
